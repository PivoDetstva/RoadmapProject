The diary Roadmap Project. 
This console(for now) app is made as a some kind of a diary, where programmer can show his way from a some point in his road. This app have functions of adding entries, with code or not.
The future plan to make it a GUI app based on Qt where all the operations will have a graphic optimisation. You would see entries in a diary and would be able to see a code attached to them. Entries have 4 parts, date, when it was created or when code attached to entry was written. The title, basically the key how you would find your entries. Text, explaining the entry, what is inside, in a base list this text is not shown. Path, that's the part where .cpp files can be attached to an entry, for example, if you learned new topic, except just plain text with block of code, you can attach .cpp file as to show a pure practice experience and write some debugging cases that caused with that. 

The project right now in a very very raw format, it's now v0.5, the 1.0 will be considered a console version of this. In a not far future, after the core will be made, it would rise to a frontend part as well, and it would be even more interesting. A lot changes and refactoring could be done here. And will be.     

Made by me in 2026.
